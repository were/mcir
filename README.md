# Modern Compiler Implemented in Rust


## Tutorial

In this repo, I will build my own language targeting WebAssembly.

- [Language Manual](./writeup/00-manual.md)
- [Introduction](./writeup/01-intro.md)
- [Parser](./writeup/02-parser.md)

## Reference Implementation

A reference Rust implementation is available at the [sub-repo](https://github.com/were/ecc-rust).
Test cases are available at the `tests` folder.
If you want to develop your own compiler,
you no longer need to design test cases from scratch.
